Pocket Watch
------------

This program started out as a program to show some gears and how they interact. That was boring, so I added a watch face and then went hunting for 3DS models of watches and now I have this cool app. The app has some transparent surfaces, spherical environment mapping, lighting and a few other features all thrown into one :)

Press 'C' to remove the watch case and 'F' to remove the watch face and then you can see the gears in action. The gears do turn a bit faster than the dials, but running them at the correct speed was boring :)

To control the object you can click and drag with your mouse .

Mouse :
  Left Button   : Rotate object.
  Right Button  : Zoom object.
  Middle Button : Move object.

Keys :
  W : Toggle wireframe mode
  C : Show/Hide the watch case
  F : Show/Hide the watch face
  L : Toggle lighting
