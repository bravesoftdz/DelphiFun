Peristalsis
-----------

A small program that does some cool OpenGL effects. Its basically a cylinder that 
turns anti-clockwise around the screen. The cyliner also gets twisted along the 
central axis. The radius of the cylinder changes in different places. The X 
position of the cylinder moves according to a complex sin wave.

If you plan to use this effect somewhere else, please mention my name and URL.
