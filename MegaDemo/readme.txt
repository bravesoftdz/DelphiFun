  Code..........      Jan Horn

Compiled for the windows platform using Borland Delphi 5.  
  

The demo includes the bass.dll which enables it to play the MOD file.
BASS is a sound system for use in Windows 95/98/2000/NT software. 
It's purpose is to provide powerful (yet easy to use) sample, stream,
MOD music, and audio CD playback functions.

The latest version of BASS can always be found at the BASS homepage:
